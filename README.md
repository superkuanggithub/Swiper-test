# Swiper-test
just test Swiper

there are two div.div-content with ID of div1, when set loop:true;.
so when I change the status of div1 by clicking, only one of them changed it's status.
then sliding from different directions leads to different div1 with different status.
there is a similar situation on div4.
this should be the reason of bug, I guess.
